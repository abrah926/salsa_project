1. Business Logic:

    Event Management:
        Data Storage:
            Store event information (name, date, time, location, description, source, submitted_by, cancelled status, coordinates) in a MongoDB collection (e.g., "salsa_events").
            Utilize MongoDB's features like indexing for efficient data retrieval and querying.

        Data Sources:
            Web Scraping: Extract event data from websites using libraries like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy.
            Social Media APIs: Utilize APIs from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit to fetch event information.
            User Submissions: Allow users to submit new events through the application.

        Data Validation:
            Implement data validation checks (e.g., date/time format, location validity) before storing data in MongoDB.

        Event Cancellation:
            Enable users to mark events as canceled by updating the cancelled field in the MongoDB document.
            Consider implementing a mechanism to handle potentially inaccurate or outdated information (e.g., user flagging).

    Data Handling:
        Use MongoDB's aggregation framework for complex queries (e.g., finding events within a specific date range, filtering by location, etc.).
        Implement efficient data retrieval and indexing strategies to optimize query performance.

2. User Logic:

    User Authentication (Optional):
        If you want to include user authentication, you can implement it using Django's built-in user system or integrate with third-party authentication services.

    Event Discovery:
        Map View: Display events on a map using a JavaScript library like Leaflet or Mapbox GL JS.
        List View: Provide a list view of events with filtering and search options (e.g., by date, location, keywords, dance style).
        Search Functionality: Implement efficient search capabilities using MongoDB's text search or other indexing techniques.

    User Submission:
        Allow authenticated users (if applicable) to submit new events through a user-friendly form.
        Validate user input before storing it in the database.

    Event Cancellation:
        Allow users to mark events as canceled.
        Consider implementing a user feedback mechanism (e.g., flagging events as inaccurate or outdated).
